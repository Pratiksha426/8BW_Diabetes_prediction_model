# 8BW_Diabetes_prediction_model
Here, we are building a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning.
This project is done in Python.
In this project, we use Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.
Dataset used here-
             "C:\Users\ankit kumbhare\Downloads\diabetes (1).csv"
It has several  features on the basis of which diabetes disease can be predicted. Such as:-
             1. Pregnancies
             2. Glucose
             3. Skin Thickness
             4. BP
             5. BMI
             6. Insulin
             7. Age
                        etc.
